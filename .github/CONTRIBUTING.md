# Welcome!

To begin with, thanks for considering to contribute to Sentry. We actively encourage engagments, and we hope that you continue to contribute in the future!

By following our contribution guidelines, you help us manage and develop Sentry, and we can make contributing as easy as possible.

We accept all kind of contributions, from documentation, to feature requests and bug fixes. If you can improve the project, we will accept it!

# Our Expectations

* If you spot an issue, or wish to implement a new feature, please open an issue first! This allows us to track the changes, and gives us time to provide feedback on whether we feel that this is something we want to add into Sentry. We would hate for time to be spent developing a feature that we feel does not fit into the project.
* Ensure that the code meets our style guide, and does not contain any bugs or other vulnerabilities.
* Keep PR's limited to one feature each. You can always open multiple pull requests if needed ðŸ˜…

# Your First Contribution

# Getting started

To ensure that our code is maintainable, please follow these steps when working on Sentry:

1. Fork the project
2. Develop your code.
   1. We use [devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_create-a-devcontainerjson-file) as our preferred way of standardising the development environment. If you haven't used containers before, please follow the advice [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_getting-started) to setup your system
   2. Ensure that your code meets our style guide. Please run `eslint` before committing.
   3. Our code is deployed using Docker & Docker Compose. Please ensure that your code works on these images.
3. Create a pull request!
