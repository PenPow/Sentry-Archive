### üí´ Self Hosting

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is the production branch intended for the public release of Sentry. We cannot give support or advice on hosting this yourself, nor can we guarantee that the code will be supported on your host system. If you choose to proceed, here be dragons.   

Please read [this](https://github.com/PenPow/Sentry/wiki/Self-Hosting#why-should-you-self-host) before deciding to self host, as it details how to do so, and the question of whether you should do so.
