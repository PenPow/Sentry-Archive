# How Punishments Work

Sentry has a lot of options regarding punishments, this guide showcases how to master making punishments with Sentry.

## Freezing a Punishment

Sentry has the option to amend punishments after they have been enacted. To improve accountability in a server, an administrator can either manually freeze a punishment, or can enable the settings to freeze all cases immediately.

When you 🧊 a punishment, its details freeze in time, and the case is unable to be edited with the `/edit` command.

To freeze a punishment, you require `Administrator` permissions. If you are an administrator, run the `/freeze` command with the case id to freeze it.

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">This is a one way operation, once a case is frozen, it cannot be unfrozen.</Callout>

### Automatically Freezing Punishments

If you want to apply this setting to all future punishments, you can enable it with the `/settings punishments` command. Read the documentation for this command [here](/docs/settings/punishments).

This operation does not apply retroactively, and all punishments frozen while it is active cannot be unfrozen. However, once the feature is disabled, no further cases will be automatically frozen.

## Using Case References

Case References are an amazing way to improve the ease of navigation between linked cases.

For example, when unbanning somebody, you can reference their original punishment's case-id, so that it shows as a reference. Then, if somebody wants to look at the punishment at a later date, it becomes easier to understand what punishment this was referring to.

Its simple to add a reference to a case, simply add the reference option, and pass in the case-id. Sentry will then link your case to that old case.
