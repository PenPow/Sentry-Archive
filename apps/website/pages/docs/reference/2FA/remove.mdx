# Remove 2FA

If you feel you no longer need the extra touch of 2FA on your account, or if you have lost access to your authenticator app, you can use this command to remove your 2FA settings.

You need either your backup code or your authenticator app to remove your current 2FA settings. If you do not have access to these, then we cannot remove 2FA. The Support Team cannot remove 2FA from a user without being given their backup code.

## Syntax

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'
